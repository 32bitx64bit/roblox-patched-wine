Hey all. Roblox is rolling out a update to END roblox support on wine. So this repository is now useless. Switch to Windows if you still want to play roblox, or just abadon it.

SEO purposes - Patched roblox wine

Edit : Im super late, and knew of this for about 3 months now ((or whenever Sober released)) but you can nopw play roblox again via sober. Also made by the Vinegar team. Sadly closed sourced.
