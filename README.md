Hey all. Roblox is rolling out a update to END roblox support on wine. So this repository is now useless. Switch to Windows if you still want to play roblox, or just abadon it.

SEO purposes - Patched roblox wine

Edit : Im super late, and knew of this for about 3 months now ((or whenever Sober released)) but you can now play roblox again via sober. Also made by the Vinegar team. Sadly closed sourced.

(still in alpha, but its pretty stable now. Most if not all games run without issue.)
